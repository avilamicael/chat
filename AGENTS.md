# Chatwoot Development Guidelines

## Build / Test / Lint

- **Setup**: `bundle install && pnpm install`
- **Run Dev**: `pnpm dev` or `overmind start -f ./Procfile.dev`
- **Seed Local Test Data**: `bundle exec rails db:seed` (quickly populates minimal data for standard feature verification)
- **Seed Search Test Data**: `bundle exec rails search:setup_test_data` (bulk fixture generation for search/performance/manual load scenarios)
- **Seed Account Sample Data (richer test data)**: `Seeders::AccountSeeder` is available as an internal utility and is exposed through Super Admin `Accounts#seed`, but can be used directly in dev workflows too:
  - UI path: Super Admin → Accounts → Seed (enqueues `Internal::SeedAccountJob`).
  - CLI path: `bundle exec rails runner "Internal::SeedAccountJob.perform_now(Account.find(<id>))"` (or call `Seeders::AccountSeeder.new(account: Account.find(<id>)).perform!` directly).
- **Lint JS/Vue**: `pnpm eslint` / `pnpm eslint:fix`
- **Lint Ruby**: `bundle exec rubocop -a`
- **Test JS**: `pnpm test` or `pnpm test:watch`
- **Test Ruby**: `bundle exec rspec spec/path/to/file_spec.rb`
- **Single Test**: `bundle exec rspec spec/path/to/file_spec.rb:LINE_NUMBER`
- **Run Project**: `overmind start -f Procfile.dev`
- **Ruby Version**: Manage Ruby via `rvm`
- Always prefer `bundle exec` for Ruby CLI tasks (rspec, rake, rubocop, etc.)

## Code Style

- **Ruby**: Follow RuboCop rules (150 character max line length)
- **Vue/JS**: Use ESLint (Airbnb base + Vue 3 recommended)
- **Vue Components**: Use PascalCase
- **Events**: Use camelCase
- **I18n**: No bare strings in templates; use i18n
- **Error Handling**: Use custom exceptions (`lib/custom_exceptions/`)
- **Models**: Validate presence/uniqueness, add proper indexes
- **Type Safety**: Use PropTypes in Vue, strong params in Rails
- **Naming**: Use clear, descriptive names with consistent casing
- **Vue API**: Always use Composition API with `<script setup>` at the top

## Styling

- **Tailwind Only**:  
  - Do not write custom CSS  
  - Do not use scoped CSS  
  - Do not use inline styles  
  - Always use Tailwind utility classes  
- **Colors**: Refer to `tailwind.config.js` for color definitions

## General Guidelines

- MVP focus: Least code change, happy-path only
- No unnecessary defensive programming
- Ship the happy path first: limit guards/fallbacks to what production has proven necessary, then iterate
- Prefer minimal, readable code over elaborate abstractions; clarity beats cleverness
- Break down complex tasks into small, testable units
- Iterate after confirmation
- Avoid writing specs unless explicitly asked
- Remove dead/unreachable/unused code
- Don’t write multiple versions or backups for the same logic — pick the best approach and implement it
- Prefer `with_modified_env` (from spec helpers) over stubbing `ENV` directly in specs
- Specs in parallel/reloading environments: prefer comparing `error.class.name` over constant class equality when asserting raised errors

## Codex Worktree Workflow

- Use a separate git worktree + branch per task to keep changes isolated.
- Keep Codex-specific local setup under `.codex/` and use `Procfile.worktree` for worktree process orchestration.
- The setup workflow in `.codex/environments/environment.toml` should dynamically generate per-worktree DB/port values (Rails, Vite, Redis DB index) to avoid collisions.
- Start each worktree with its own Overmind socket/title so multiple instances can run at the same time.

## Commit Messages

- Prefer Conventional Commits: `type(scope): subject` (scope optional)
- Example: `feat(auth): add user authentication`
- Don't reference Claude in commit messages

## PR Description Format

- Start with a short, user-facing paragraph describing the product change.
- Add a `Closes` section with relevant issue links (GitHub, Linear, etc.).
- For feature PRs, add `How to test` from a product/UX standpoint.
- For bugfix PRs, use `How to reproduce` when helpful.
- Optionally add a `What changed` section for implementation highlights.
- Do not add a `How this was tested` section listing specs/commands.

## Project-Specific

- **Translations**:
  - Only update `en.yml` and `en.json`
  - Other languages are handled by the community
  - Backend i18n → `en.yml`, Frontend i18n → `en.json`
- **Frontend**:
  - Use `components-next/` for message bubbles (the rest is being deprecated)

## Ruby Best Practices

- Use compact `module/class` definitions; avoid nested styles

## Enterprise Edition Notes

- Chatwoot has an Enterprise overlay under `enterprise/` that extends/overrides OSS code.
- When you add or modify core functionality, always check for corresponding files in `enterprise/` and keep behavior compatible.
- Follow the Enterprise development practices documented here:
  - https://chatwoot.help/hc/handbook/articles/developing-enterprise-edition-features-38

Practical checklist for any change impacting core logic or public APIs
- Search for related files in both trees before editing (e.g., `rg -n "FooService|ControllerName|ModelName" app enterprise`).
- If adding new endpoints, services, or models, consider whether Enterprise needs:
  - An override (e.g., `enterprise/app/...`), or
  - An extension point (e.g., `prepend_mod_with`, hooks, configuration) to avoid hard forks.
- Avoid hardcoding instance- or plan-specific behavior in OSS; prefer configuration, feature flags, or extension points consumed by Enterprise.
- Keep request/response contracts stable across OSS and Enterprise; update both sets of routes/controllers when introducing new APIs.
- When renaming/moving shared code, mirror the change in `enterprise/` to prevent drift.
- Tests: Add Enterprise-specific specs under `spec/enterprise`, mirroring OSS spec layout where applicable.
- When modifying existing OSS features for Enterprise-only behavior, add an Enterprise module (via `prepend_mod_with`/`include_mod_with`) instead of editing OSS files directly—especially for policies, controllers, and services. For Enterprise-exclusive features, place code directly under `enterprise/`.

## Branding / White-labeling note

- For user-facing strings that currently contain "Chatwoot" but should adapt to branded/self-hosted installs, prefer applying `replaceInstallationName` from `shared/composables/useBranding` in the UI layer (for example tooltip and suggestion labels) instead of adding hardcoded brand-specific copy.

## Obsidian Vault (Knowledge Base)

This project has a living knowledge base in the user's Obsidian vault at `D:\001_obsidian\chatwoot\` (Windows), accessible from WSL2 via the Obsidian REST API.

### Accessing the vault

Use the MCP tools (`mcp__mcp-obsidian__*`) directly — they are configured and working.

```
mcp__mcp-obsidian__obsidian_list_files_in_vault        → list all files
mcp__mcp-obsidian__obsidian_get_file_contents          → read a note
mcp__mcp-obsidian__obsidian_batch_get_file_contents    → read multiple notes at once
mcp__mcp-obsidian__obsidian_simple_search              → full-text search
mcp__mcp-obsidian__obsidian_complex_search             → Dataview DQL search
mcp__mcp-obsidian__obsidian_patch_content              → edit a section by heading
mcp__mcp-obsidian__obsidian_append_content             → append to end of note
mcp__mcp-obsidian__obsidian_get_recent_changes         → recently modified files
```

Prefer `obsidian_patch_content` (targeted section edit) over rewriting entire files when updating a single section.

### Vault notes and what they cover

| File | What to update it for |
|------|-----------------------|
| `index.md` | New modules or major structural changes |
| `kanban.md` | Any change to kanban models, API, services, or frontend |
| `billing.md` | Changes to billing logic, plans, or trial handling |
| `whitelabel.md` | Changes to branding/InstallationConfig |
| `architecture.md` | New patterns, data flows, or structural decisions |
| `config.md` | New env vars, feature flags, scheduled jobs, or routes |
| `rules.md` | Changes to conventions or guidelines |
| `security.md` | New auth logic, policies, or security considerations |
| `planning.md` | Completed tasks, new backlog items, or decisions made |

### Rule: always update the vault after significant changes

**This is a strict rule — no exceptions.**

- The vault is the single source of truth for all project knowledge in this codebase.
- All data, decisions, progress, architectural notes, and changes **must** be recorded in the appropriate `chatwoot/` note.
- After completing **any** non-trivial task (new feature, API change, new model, new env var, architectural decision, completed or planned roadmap item), update the relevant note(s) in the vault **before** considering the task done.
- Prefer `obsidian_patch_content` (targeted section edit) over rewriting entire files when updating a single section.
- When in doubt about which note to update, update `planning.md` at minimum.
